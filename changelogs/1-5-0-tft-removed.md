# End of TFT partnership

I decided to put an end to TFT's integration, since I did not agree with some of the reasons people were getting blacklisted for. The goal of this extension is and will always be about adding QoLs features to this trading site. By establishing a partnership with TFT, I thought it would help players against scammers. Now, I feel like it's less about blocking scammers and more about enforcing their own trading etiquette. As the publisher of this extension, I'm no longer comfortable to force this into your browsers.

BetterTrading is still alive and will continue to deliver QoLs features. For the TFT members out there, they will be releasing an extension of their own that should offer a better implementation of the blacklist.

Stay safe exiles. ✌️
